# About sndwch

The history of sndwch is the history of all of us, really. Who among us hasn’t set bravely forth to challenge the boundaries that limited those who came before us? Who hasn’t felt the call to shed the senseless burdens of previous generations and embrace a brighter, happier, more unified future?

At sndwch, we believe in bringing people together. The overly restrictive labels of our past have divided us for too long.

Forget the labels. You don’t need to stand alone. Explore a new world of joyful, unburdened flavors.

Because when you’re here, just about everything can be a sandwich.
